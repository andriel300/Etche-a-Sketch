# Etche-a-Sketch Project

This is a browser-based Etch-a-Sketch project where the user can draw on a grid with a color picker or a rainbow pen. The project is implemented using JavaScript and DOM manipulation techniques.

## Difficulty

The project was of moderate to higher difficulty. It required knowledge of JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation. The key challenge was to handle mouse movements to paint on the grid, especially when using the rainbow pen, which required listening to mouse events such as `mousedown`, `mouseup`, and `mouseenter`.

## Lessons learned about Event Listener and DOM Manipulation Skills

I learned the following skills while working on this project:

- Using `querySelector` and `getElementById` to get DOM elements.
- Adding event listeners to DOM elements using `addEventListener`.
- Using template literals and ternary operator to set the size of the grid.
- Using `createElement` to create new DOM elements.
- Changing CSS styles of DOM elements using style.
- Listening to mouse events such as `mousedown`, `mouseup`, and `mouseenter`.
- Removing event listeners using `removeEventListener`.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project was a good exercise to improve my JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation skills. The project helped me to understand how to manipulate the DOM and handle user events to create an interactive browser-based application.
