# Etche-a-Sketch

The code is an implementation of an Etch-a-Sketch game where a user can draw on a grid of squares using the mouse. The grid size is adjustable using a slider, and the squares change color based on the user's interaction with the mouse. The user can select a color using a color picker or enable a rainbow mode where the colors change randomly. There is also an eraser button to clear the grid.

The code uses event listeners to detect mouse events such as clicks and mouse movement on the grid squares. When a user interacts with a square, the square's color changes based on the user's input. The rainbow mode generates a random color each time the user clicks on a square.
